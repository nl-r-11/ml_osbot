1. osbot
2. python openai gynasnium and 
3. stable baselines3 ppo 

Tech stack (clean, minimal)
	Game interface (Java)
	OSBot script
	Role: read true game state, execute actions, control timing
	Decision / learning (Python)
	Stable Baselines3 (PPO)
	Gymnasium wrapper (custom env)
	Role: choose actions from state
	Glue (local IPC)
	Localhost TCP / HTTP (JSON messages)
	Role: Java ⇄ Python communication

Core process (end-to-end)

	Define the abstraction
	State vector (numbers/booleans only):
	hp, food_count, is_animating, at_bank, dist_to_target, enemy_hp
	Action space (macros):
	MOVE_BANK, ATTACK, EAT, IDLE
	Build the Gym environment (Python)
	Gym is fake + parameterized, not OSRS itself
	Simulates transitions + rewards
	Train PPO fast and safely (no bans, resettable)
	Train PPO
	Reward examples:
	+damage, +kills, −death, −idle_time
	PPO learns a policy: state → action

Live execution (real OSRS)

	OSBot onLoop():
	Read state via OSBot API
	Send JSON → Python
	Receive action ID
	Execute macro via OSBot
	PPO does no clicking, only decisions
	Optional: freeze learning or do tiny online updates


What you’d build first (order)

	OSBot script that only reports state + executes hardcoded 	actions
	Local IPC JSON round-trip
	Gym env that mirrors that state/action space
	PPO training on a single task (e.g., attack + eat)
	Plug trained PPO into live OSBot loop
	



step 1 before starting any bot like this
	1. define state
	2. define actions
	3. gym environment
	4. design rules
